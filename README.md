# Minimizing Churn Subscription
This repository contains code and insights on minimizing churn in a subscription-based service. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Objective
The primary objective is to predict and minimize the churn rate by analyzing various features and employing machine learning models.

## Contents
### Importing Libraries and Data
The notebook begins with importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and reads the churn dataset using Pandas.

### Cleaning the Dataset
The dataset is explored using df.head(), df.columns, and df.describe() to understand its structure and characteristics. The cleaning process involves handling missing values by dropping columns with a significant number of NULLs and removing rows with NULLs in specific columns.
